           <h2>Srinivas</h2>
           <p1>The service at Sai Ram Restaurant was friendly and attentive. The staff greeted us promptly upon arrival and were knowledgeable about the menu, offering good recommendations. Our food arrived at a reasonable pace, and the staff ensured we had everything we needed. However, there was a slight delay in refilling water glasses, but it didn't affect the overallÂ experience.</p1>
